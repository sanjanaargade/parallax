  <h1>Bucket List Travel</h1>
  <p>Travel should be meaningful. It should excite and inspire you, rejuvenate and ground you, educate and challenge you, and most of all, it should humble you. Travel gives us our greatest stories, our most cherished memories and countless irreplaceable learnings that we can choose to pay forward to others. It teaches us about ourselves and each other, it broadens our horizons and, just like a reset button, it forces us to refocus on what really matters.</p>

<h1>Rome</h1>

<h1>London</h1>
  <p>London — home to world-class restaurants, an unparalleled music scene, and some seriously rich history. London is a wonderful city to visit, and with England's fantastic public transportation. You could easily spend a week or more exploring all that each London neighborhood has to offer, and still have things left over for your next visit.</p>

<h1>Paris</h1>
  <p>Paris is a city unlike any other. It is overflowing with culture, history, and beauty. And while people travel to Paris to see the Louvre, climb the Eiffel Tower, or see Notre-Dame, the real magic is found in the streets.</p>

<h1>Tokyo</h1>
  <p>Tokyo is a city of surprises — ancient temples are nestled among modern skyscrapers and you're just as likely to see someone wearing a cosplay costume as you are to see someone dressed in a traditional kimono. Tokyo is the most populated city in the world. English is not widely spoken, and the far-reaching effect of globalization is still minimal. It is a true breath of fresh air among the myriad destinations that lost themselves in their quest to cater to tourists and meet global ideals.

<h1>Barcelona</h1>
  <p>Barcelona is a colorful melting pot of culture, full of world-renowned cuisine, legendary art, music, and more. Book a trip to this sunny city and you'll spend your days exploring the dynamic barrios, wandering along the beach, strolling through verdant green spaces, and discovering gem after gem—some well known, like Park Güell or Camp Nou, and some hidden, like Santa Caterina.</p>

<h1>Dubai</h1>
  <p>Dubai is full of contrasts. There's the glittering skyline, made up of skyscrapers so tall they defy imagination; the modern collection of stores and eateries, offering up every kind of option a traveler could possibly want; and the luxurious hotels, ready to welcome even the most discerning traveler in style and excess.</p>

<h1>Bali</h1>
  <p>The most fulfilling and thrilling Bali holidays include a few locations, so don't stress about picking just one vibe or scene—it's best to combine a few, two if you're short on time. There's no sense in rushing through temple tours and tastes, yoga sessions, shopping, and Balinese massages. Enjoy island time and the locals who are overwhelmingly generous, sweet, and genuine. All factors considered, it's nearly impossible not to leave Bali feeling far better—happier, healthier, and definitely more tan — than when you landed.</p>

<h1>Florence</h1>
  <p>This is a city surrounded by nature like no other. Cross the Ponte Vecchio and the river Arno is the Oltrarno district, home to cobblestone piazzas, laidback cafes, and artisans plying centuries-old trades. You can stroll along the riverside, explore exquisite gardens laid out in the Renaissance, or wind around cypress-studded hills. At every turn, you'll get killer views of the city and its gargantuan terracotta dome, standing out against the mountains in the distance. In Florence, even the landscape is art.
